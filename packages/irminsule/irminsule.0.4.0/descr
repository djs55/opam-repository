Irminsule, the database that never forgets

Irminsule is a distributed database with built-in snapshot, branch and
revert mechanisms. It is designed to use a large variety of backends,
although it is optimized for append-only store.

Irminsule is written in pure OCaml. It can thus be compiled to Javascript
-- and run in the browsers; or into a Mirage microkernel -- and run directly
on top of Xen.
